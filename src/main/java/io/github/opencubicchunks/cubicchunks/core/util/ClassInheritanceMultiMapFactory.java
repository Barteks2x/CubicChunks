         *
         * The only way to actually fix it is to change vanilla code, which I'm not going to do.
         * Replacing ALL_KNOWN with concurrent hash set won't fix it, synchronization is necessary here.
         * The issue is that one thread may add something to ALL_KNOWN while the constructor in other thread
         * is iterating over the set.
         * It rarely/never happens in vanilla because timings happen to be just right to avoid the issue
